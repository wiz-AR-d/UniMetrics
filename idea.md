# UniMetrics – Multi-Tenant Academic Performance Intelligence System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Universities and colleges struggle to:

- Identify students at academic risk early
- Detect performance gaps across departments
- Monitor semester-wise trends
- Track attendance impact on grades
- Evaluate faculty performance objectively
- Generate actionable institutional insights

Existing systems only store marks — they do not generate intelligence.

## 🎯 Solution Overview

UniMetrics is a multi-tenant SaaS-based Academic Performance Intelligence System designed for universities and colleges.

It enables multiple universities to register on the platform and independently manage:

- Departments
- Courses
- Students
- Faculty
- Exams
- Grades
- Risk profiles

The system analyzes academic data to:

- Compute CGPA
- Detect backlog risks
- Predict academic probation
- Generate alerts
- Provide institutional analytics dashboards

## 🏛 Multi-Tenant Architecture

UniMetrics supports multiple universities within a single system.

Each university's data is isolated using `university_id` across all major entities.

All database queries are scoped to:

WHERE university_id = currentUser.universityId

This ensures strict tenant isolation.
